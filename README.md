### Project: CP Test

Welcome to the CP Test project! This README will guide you through the process of cloning the repository, setting up your environment, and revising the code.


### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:
- Git
- Python (version 3.8 or above)
- pip (Python package installer)

### Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TP6chunwei/test_CP.git
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### Setting Up the Environment
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd test_CP
```

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Code
To run the code, use the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will execute the main script of the project.

### Revising the Code
To make changes to the code, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm).
2. Navigate to the project directory (`test_CP`).
3. Make the desired changes to the code files.
4. Save your changes.

If you want to test your changes, run the code again using:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-name
   ```
4. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Description of the feature or fix"
   ```
5. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-or-bugfix-name
   ```
6. Create a pull request on the original repository, describing your changes and the purpose of the pull request.
